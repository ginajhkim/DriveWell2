- [What does it do?]

Our project is an ios app that is meant to improve road safety by helping drivers build good diriving habits. The app monitors  a user's driving habits such as speeding, sudden acceleration, and sudden stops. After finishing a trip, users will be given a score for the current trip they made. In the app, there are also a page where users can check their ranking and another page includes a history of the trips they have been made.

- [What problem does it try to solve? What was the inspiration behind the project idea?]

Our project aims to promote safe driving habits.

The inspiration came from the strategies suggested by the city of vancouver. We refered to the Canadian government website (https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-transportation/personal-vehicles/fuel-efficient-driving-techniques/21038) for ways for improving road safety.

- [What is your stack? What language did you program it in? What APIâ€™s did you use?]

We used swift, apple core motion api, and xcode for creating the app.


***


- [What are the next steps to complete the project?]

We would like to implement the functionalities to measure the sudden acceleration/stops as well as to store data into the firebase.
